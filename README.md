trainer-irregular-verbs for Linux
=================================

Train irregular verbs for school-kids and anyone who want to train them.


This is the python version of an old program, which I'm had written for myself in the late nineties.
The first version was written in QBasic (Windows 95), later I want to lern some python-code and I'm doing a complete rewrite of the old code. New in the python version is the GUI (Tkinter), which is not completely ready at the moment.

The Shell Version should work well (I hope so) and is recommended.

Requirements: Python 3 and Linux

Have fun!
